# Cool Stuff in DL

## Mathematical
Formula for estimators, these intros are from R studio document.

## TDA
Full use of Topological data analysis in the package `TDA`, and real-world use in HeartFailure and Iris.

## MapperAlgorithm
Mapper algorithm example and trefoil, torus data visualization, and real-world use in Diabetes and Iris.

## TopologyNN
Conception of a neural network based on topology, you can learn neural network from topological perspective.

## TopologyAndData
This is a note from [TOPOLOGY AND DATA](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf), a reference that introduce topology, including most of the knowledge you need to know for TDA.
