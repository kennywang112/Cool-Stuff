## Data Visualization and Preliminary Analysis
- Start by generating points uniformly distributed around a circle and visualizing these points. This step is fundamental to understanding the distribution of the data and lays the groundwork for further TDA analysis.
## Density Estimation and Topological Features
- Applied various density estimation methods (such as DTM, kNN, KDE) that help to understand the spatial distribution of data. Specifically, then use these methods to create density plots of the data, which is particularly useful for identifying potential clusters or patterns within the dataset.
## Persistent Homology Analysis
- Conducte a persistent homology analysis, the core of TDA, revealing topological features of the data, such as connectivity, holes, and voids. By analyzing the diagrams generated from different density estimations, identify and compare the topological features present in the data.
## Alpha Complexes and Rips Complexes
- Demonstrate how to use Alpha complexes and Rips complexes to build topological representations of the data. These methods help to understand the shape and structure of the data and how it changes with varying parameters (like radius size).
## Visualization of Topological Features
- With persistence diagrams and barcodes, visualize the data's topological features, aiding in the identification of significant structural features and their stability within the data.
## Analysis Examples
- By creating complex datasets, such as circles of different radii with added noise, show how TDA can identify and differentiate between various topological features.
## Parameter Selection and Model Evaluation
- Explore how different parameter settings affect density estimation and the extraction of topological features, and how bootstrap methods and persistence diagrams are used to assess model stability and confidence intervals.
