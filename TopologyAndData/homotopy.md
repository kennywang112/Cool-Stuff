### <font color="#6aa881">Homotopy</font>
Imagine you have two continuous functions, $f, g: X \rightarrow Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces (think of these spaces as geometric shapes or surfaces, which can be lines, planes, volumes, or even more complex structures). If there exists a continuous function $H: X \times [0, 1] \rightarrow Y$ such that:

- For every $x$ in $X$, $H(x, 0) = f(x)$.
- For every $x$ in $X$, $H(x, 1) = g(x)$.

Then, $f$ and $g$ are said to be homotopic. In simpler terms, homotopy is a way to continuously **morph** one function into another without **breaking** or **jumping**. The function $H$ can be viewed as a morphing process, where the change from $0$ to $1$ represents the continuous transition from $f$ to $g$.

### <font color="#6aa881">Homotopy Equivalence</font>
Suppose there are functions $f: X \rightarrow Y$ and $G: Y \rightarrow X$ such that:

- $f$ followed by $G$ (denoted $G \circ f$ or $G(f(x))$) is homotopic to the identity map on $X$.
- $G$ followed by $f$ (denoted $f \circ G$ or $f(G(x))$) is homotopic to the identity map on $Y$.

Then, $f$ is a homotopy equivalence, and the spaces $X$ and $Y$ are said to be homotopy equivalent. In simple terms, if you can continuously deform one space into another and then deform it back, those two spaces are homotopy equivalent.

### <font color="#6aa881">Contractible</font>
A space is called contractible if it is homotopy equivalent to a single point. Intuitively, if you can continuously **shrink** a space down to a point (not just squishing it to a point, but through a process that maintains continuity), then the space is contractible.

### <font color="#6aa881">Example for homotopy</font>
**Spaces \(X\) and \(Y\)**

Suppose:

- X is the real number line, represented by $\mathbb{R}$, which includes all real numbers.
- Y is also the real number line $\mathbb{R}$.

**Defining Two Functions**

Let's define two functions $f, g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as follows:

- $f(x) = x$, which is the identity function. This function doesn't change its input value.
- $g(x) = x^2$, which maps each input $x$ to its square.

**Defining a Homotopy $H$**

We aim to find a homotopy $H: \mathbb{R} \times [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that "connects" $f$ and $g$, being $f$ at $t=0$ and $g$ at $t=1$. A simple choice for $H$ is:

$H(x, t) = (1-t)x + t(x^2)$

Here, $H(x, t)$ smoothly transitions from $f(x) = x$ to $g(x) = x^2$ depending on the value of $t$. Specifically:

- When $t = 0$, $H(x, 0) = (1-0)x + 0(x^2) = x$, thus $H(x, 0) = f(x)$.
- When $t = 1$, $H(x, 1) = (1-1)x + 1(x^2) = x^2$, thus $H(x, 1) = g(x)$.
- For $0 < t < 1$, $H(x, t)$ is an intermediate state between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, representing a smooth transition from $x$ to $x^2$.

**Understanding $H$**

This homotopy $H$ provides a clear example of how $X \times [0, 1]$ can be used to describe a continuous transition between two functions. By varying the value of $t$, we can observe how the change from $x$ to $x^2$ occurs continuously, with $t$ serving as a "time" parameter that controls the speed and manner of the transition.

### <font color="#6aa881">Homology Groups </font>$H_k(X,A)$

- **Topological Space $X$**: A set of points with properties defining continuity, convergence, and boundaries. Common examples include lines, circles, and spheres.
- **Abelian Group $A$**: A mathematical group where every two elements $a$ and $b$ satisfy $a + b = b + a$. Common examples include integers under addition.
- **Integer $k \geq 0$**: Represents the dimension in which we're studying the space. For example, $k=0$ might represent points, $k=1$ lines, $k=2$ surfaces, and so on.
- **Homology Group $H_k(X,A)$**: A structure that, intuitively, captures the $k$-dimensional "holes" in the space $X$, with "coefficients" in the group $A$. These "holes" are essential features of the space that persist under continuous transformations.

### <font color="#6aa881">Functoriality</font>

This property describes how homology groups behave under continuous maps between topological spaces:

- **Continuous Map $f: X \rightarrow Y$**: A function between two spaces where the pre-image of any open set is open.
- **Induced Homomorphism $H_k(f,A)$**: A function between homology groups $H_k(X,A) \rightarrow H_k(Y,A)$ that's "induced" by $f$, preserving the algebraic structure.
- **Composition and Identity**:
- For two continuous maps $f: X \rightarrow Y$ and $g: Y \rightarrow Z$, $H_k(f \circ g, A) = H_k(f,A) \circ H_k(g,A)$, meaning the homology of the composition is the composition of the homologies.
- $H_k(Id_X; A) = Id_{H_k(X,A)}$, meaning the homology of the identity map is the identity homomorphism.

### <font color="#6aa881">Homotopy Invariance</font>

If two maps $f$ and $g$ are homotopic, their induced homomorphisms on homology groups are equal: $H_k(f,A) = H_k(g,A)$. This implies that if two spaces are homotopy equivalent, their homology groups in the same dimension are isomorphic (structurally identical).

### <font color="#6aa881">Normalization</font>

$H_0(\ast, A) \approx A$, where $\ast$ denotes a space consisting of **a single point**. This means the zeroth homology group of a point space with coefficients in $A$ is isomorphic to $A$ itself.

### <font color="#6aa881">Betti Numbers</font>

For any field $F$ (a special type of abelian group), $H_k(X,F)$ is a vector space over $F$. The dimension of this vector space, if finite, is the $k$-th Betti number $\beta_k(X,F)$, which intuitively represents the number of independent $k$-dimensional **"holes"** or features in the space. Homotopy equivalent spaces have identical Betti numbers for all $k$, highlighting the topological invariance of these numbers.
